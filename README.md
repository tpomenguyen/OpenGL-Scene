How do I approach designing software?

In approaching designing software I first look at the required task and break down the tasks given into sections to be completed.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have had no prior skills in OpenGL but made use of skills in C++ and use of Visual Studios. Following the tutorials throughout the course helped allowed me build new skills in implemting camera movement, object design, and lighting.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I completed the weekly assignments which helped build my skills to implement for my 3D scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics learned from my design approach was to take each step incrementally and apply the learned knowledge for each step of the 3D process.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs by taking each step incrementally. I develop one feature one by one and test the feature to ensure the feature is working.
Iteration was a big factor in completing the project as it allowed me to complete each milestone in an interactive way. I built each step through each milestone which allowed me to complete the final project by combining each milestone to the final product.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me in reaching my goals as it continues to educate me in computer technology and programming. Creating an a 3D scene in OpenGL gave me an understanding on how developers create scenes, implementing textures to the objects, and how illuminating the scene can affect a scene as a whole.
